- [] The latest [repo version](https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote/archive/master.zip) is used.
- [] Any code referenced is provided and if over 30 lines a gist is linked INSTEAD of it being pasted in here.
- [] The title of the issue is helpful and relevant.
- [] I checked, if at least one of the examples was working.
