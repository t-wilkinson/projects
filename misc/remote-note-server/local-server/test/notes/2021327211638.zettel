    - Why IC?
        - A more *personalized* and *customized* shopping experience

    - Why rent?
        - Don't have clothes you love just sit in the closet.
        - Feel and look great for events.
        - When you need clothes for an event.
        - Would the items feel clean and fresh?
        - How would the clothes fit?
        - Could it actually save me money?
        - Would the clothes be age-appropriate?
        - I’ve found I really like the variety rentals offer and the chance to try out new styles and brands. The truth is, I don’t always want to shell out hundreds of dollars on a piece I only wear a few times a year. And renting allows me to try before I buy.  And also without succumbing to fast-fashion – which can be oh so tempting, but in reality is bad for our environment.
        - The upside is, IF there’s something I just love so much, that I can’t bear to send back, most programs have an option to buy pieces at a reduced cost. So far though, I haven’t bought any of the pieces I’ve been renting. Wearing it a few times has totally satiated my need for new. But, I have kept a few pieces for multiple months because they were that good. And in some cases, I even re-rented a few because I liked them so much.
        - IMHO, rentals seem to work really well for the “frosting” pieces. The more unique items. You know, those pieces that are memorable and that you might get sick of after a few wears. But that’s often what we need to make an outfit feel special and not basic and boring.

    - Why sustainable?
        - There are many clothes rental services. Sustainable sets us apart.
        - Sustainable is like organic or meat industries. Most people don't care, and aren't interested in making tradeoffs.
        - Only benefits people if they value sustainable fashion. What demographics care about sustainable fashion?
        - There are as many positive connotations as negative
        - Want to know there will be no compromises
        - Will be better long term once sustainable becomes better
        - Are we carbon neutral? What does that even mean?
        - After orders etc., communicate to the user the part they are playing in sustainability. How much water/carbon have they saved by using us?
